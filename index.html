					check along with the source code. I have a strong hold in Both Python 3 and Javascript and a good
					knowledge of Data structures and Algorithms. I also have good grasp in front end of web developent
					which includes
					HTML/CSS and flexbox. Also have an intermediate knowledge of Asyncio, which is a python module used
					for asynchronous programming which makes our code faster and have a good understading of pygame
					which is also a python module used for making games.</p>

				<p> Currently training in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence along with the back end of web
					development. You can check my upcoming projects in these topics in the project section. You can

			<h2> Covid 19 Tracker </h2>
			<video src="videos/COVID-19 Tracker.mp4" controls></video>
			<p> A LIVE Covid 19 Tracker mady by using REACT.js and Material UI and backed by Firebase. The Project shows
				a live accurate
				data of total confirmed cases, recovered and deaths worldwide and also specifically for every country
				affected by COVID-19.
				All the data are taken from <a href="https://disease.sh/docs/" target="_blank">disease.sh</a> which is
				an open API for disease related statistics and it constantly regulates and updates the data after every
				10 mins.
			</p>
			<p> The project uses chart.js and leaflet to show graphical representation of the cases and all the counties
				affected worldwide.
				There is also a dropdown menu showing all the affected country sorted by the total number of confirmed
				cases till date. The Worldwide map is completly responsive and shows the location of the country when
				selected from
				the drop down menu. The graph is made to show the new cases, recovered and deaths happening worldwide
				everyday for
				the past 120 days.
			</p>

				You can check the complete deployed version of the project <a

			<h2> Amazon Price Tracker </h2>
			<video src="videos/Amazon Price Tracer.mp4" controls></video>
			<p>This Project is a web scraper which pulls out the data of any given product using the unique Amazon ID
				which is different for
				every product in Amazon. By using this ID it opens up the page of that particular product in amazon and
				pulls out all the
				information like price, seller, link and description of the product along with the date and time when
				the data was pulled using
				Selenium.
				The same process gets repeated for the required number of product from the user and after taking out all
				the information, it
				creates a report in a JSON file format and tells the user about the best product within the price range.
			</p>

			<p>
				The process is completely automated so the user only needs to enter the product name and price range and
				selenium will do
				the rest. The reason for using Selenium instead of Request is that the Amazon website does not provide
				all the information
				when the request method is used.

			<h2> Space Force </h2>

			<p> A simple two dimensional space shooting game using the python module pygame, in which we need to control
				a spaceship and the enemy ships will be coming from front. We can complete move our spaceship in all
				four direction using WSAD from the keyboard. The enemy ships will be constantly shooting at us and we
				need to shoot back and destroy their spaceship using Space button from keyboard.</p>

			<h2> Password Checker </h2>
			<video src="videos/Password Checker.mp4" controls></video>
			<p> Recently, there was a data breach in big tech companies from hacker group and most of the account got
				hacked along with the password. But unkowingly people are still using the same password for there
				accounts made in Facebook, Youtube, Twitter etc. We hear a lot of hacking news on a daily basis. So I
				made a
				Password checker to see whether your password was ever been hacked. Now there is a website named have
				you been pwned which takes your password and check in it's server which has all the leaked account to
				see whether your password is secure or not. </p>

			<p> The problem is we can't even trust this website so I made a program in which you enter your password and
				the program converts it into hashes and then send the first five character of the hashes. The website
				response by giving a list of all the passsword in which the first five hashes are same. so if the
				complete hash code is present in any of the password from the list that means the password of the user
				was
				hacked before and the user need to change it, Otherwise its all good.</p>

			<h2> Path Finder </h2>
			<video src="videos/Path Finder.mp4" controls></video>
			<p> The projct is based on A* algorithm, which is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search,
				meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a
				graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled,
				shortest time). It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending
				those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied. At each iteration of its
				main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path
				and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal.</p>
			<p> The graph used for this particular project is not weighted that means every edge of the tree is taken
				equally and then applied the searches. The working of the complete algorithm is applied in pygame in
				which we can visualise how the algorithm actually works.</p>

			<h2> Hacker News </h2>

			<p>
				Get the top tech news of the day. The project is based on web scraping using python module Beautiful
				Soup 4 from which we can collect the required data from the
				ycombinator news webpage and convert the data into a JSON file and create a report out of it to get the
				top tech news of the day and sort the news according to the number
				of votes it's getting.
			</p>
			<p>
				After getting the report in the JSON file, the user can check the title and go to the link to read more
				about it.
